## Potential Security Considerations

### For Production Deployment

1. **HTTPS/SSL**
   - ⚠️ Must be enabled in production
   - ⚠️ Set SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
   - ⚠️ Configure HSTS header

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - ℹ️ Consider adding rate limiting to API endpoints
   - ℹ️ Laravel provides throttle middleware

3. **Content Security Policy**
   - ℹ️ Current CSP allows 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval'
   - ℹ️ May need adjustment based on third-party scripts
   - ℹ️ Consider using nonce-based CSP for production

4. **Database Backups**
   - ⚠️ Must be configured for production
   - ⚠️ Automated backup schedule recommended
   - ⚠️ Test restoration procedures

5. **Log Management**
   - ℹ️ Configure log rotation
   - ℹ️ Secure log file access
   - ℹ️ Consider centralized logging

6. **Monitoring**
   - ℹ️ Set up security event monitoring
   - ℹ️ Failed login attempt tracking
   - ℹ️ Unusual activity detection
